# 3D Stealth Game

Author: Joshua Verhoeff

In this game the goal is to find 3 codes around the map so that you can gain access to a office that contains documents that you are trying to steal. In the mean time, guards are patroling the map, and the player needs to avoid them so that they are not detected. If detected the guards will run to an alarm panel and press an alarm which will end the game.

This game was developed to learn:

- Asset prototyping
- Level building
- Enemy AI
- 3D animations
